Forex Session Reminder Script
Overview
This Python script serves as a reminder for Forex trading sessions, designed to run on Windows and notify the user when each Forex session begins and ends, according to South Africa Standard Time (SAST). The script will:

Play a sound when each Forex session starts.
Print a message to the command prompt indicating which session has started.
Play a different sound when the session ends.
Print a message to the command prompt indicating which session has ended.
The Forex sessions included are:

Sydney: 12:00 AM - 8:00 AM SAST
Tokyo: 2:00 AM - 10:00 AM SAST
London: 10:00 AM - 6:00 PM SAST
New York: 3:00 PM - 11:00 PM SAST
Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x: Download and install from here.

Required Python libraries: You can install them via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame schedule
Sound files: You need to provide your own sound files to play when sessions start and end. These should be in .mp3 format or any supported format for pygame:

Replace "start_sound.mp3" with the path to your sound file for session starts.
Replace "end_sound.mp3" with the path to your sound file for session ends.
How to Use
1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pygame schedule
2. Replace Sound Files
Replace the placeholder sound files in the code with the actual paths to your own .mp3 files:

Start sound: Replace "start_sound.mp3" in the play_start_sound() function.
End sound: Replace "end_sound.mp3" in the play_end_sound() function.
3. Running the Script
Save the Python script (e.g., forex_session_reminder.py).

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder where the script is saved.

Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python forex_session_reminder.py
4. The Script's Functionality
Once the script is running, it will:

Schedule and track the start and end times for each Forex session based on South Africa Standard Time (SAST).
Play the specified sound file when a session starts.
Print a message to the command prompt indicating which session has started.
Play a different sound when a session ends.
Print a message to the command prompt indicating which session has ended.
5. Keep the Script Running
The script runs indefinitely until stopped. You can stop it by pressing Ctrl+C in the terminal or command prompt.

Example Output
When the Sydney session starts at 12:00 AM SAST, the command prompt will display:

Copy code
Starting Sydney session!
When the Sydney session ends at 8:00 AM SAST, the command prompt will display:

Copy code
Sydney session has ended!
Customization
You can modify the start and end times of each Forex session by changing the values in the forex_sessions dictionary.
You can adjust the sounds for the sessions by using your preferred audio files.
The script uses pygame.mixer to play the sounds, which supports various audio formats. Ensure your sound files are in a supported format such as .mp3.
